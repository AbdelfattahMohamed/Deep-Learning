    "# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will learn to:**\n",
    "- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:\n",
    "    - Initializing parameters\n",
    "    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient\n",
    "    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) \n",
    "- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order."

    "#### List of Updates\n",
    "* Forward propagation formula, indexing now starts at 1 instead of 0.\n",
    "* Optimization function comment now says \"print cost every 100 training iterations\" instead of \"examples\".\n",
    "* Fixed grammar in the comments.\n",
    "* Y_prediction_test variable name is used consistently.\n",
